Get Market Orderbook
Endpoint for getting the current order book for a specific market. The order book shows all active bid orders for both yes and no sides of a binary market. It returns yes bids and no bids only (no asks are returned). This is because in binary markets, a bid for yes at price X is equivalent to an ask for no at price (100-X). For example, a yes bid at 7¢ is the same as a no ask at 93¢, with identical contract sizes. Each side shows price levels with their corresponding quantities and order counts, organized from best to worst prices.

Quick Start: Market Data
Learn how to access real-time market data without authentication

This guide will walk you through accessing Kalshi’s public market data endpoints without authentication. You’ll learn how to retrieve series information, events, markets, and orderbook data for the popular “Who will have a higher net approval” market.
​
Making Unauthenticated Requests
Kalshi provides several public endpoints that don’t require API keys. These endpoints allow you to access market data directly from our production servers at https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2.
Note about the API URL: Despite the “elections” subdomain, api.elections.kalshi.com provides access to ALL Kalshi markets - not just election-related ones. This includes markets on economics, climate, technology, entertainment, and more.
No authentication headers are required for the endpoints in this guide. You can start making requests immediately!
​
Step 1: Get Series Information
Let’s start by fetching information about the KXHIGHNY series (Highest temperature in NYC today?). This series tracks the highest temperature recorded in Central Park, New York on a given day. We’ll use the Get Series endpoint.

Python

JavaScript

cURL
import requests

# Get series information for KXHIGHNY
url = "https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/series/KXHIGHNY"
response = requests.get(url)
series_data = response.json()

print(f"Series Title: {series_data['series']['title']}")
print(f"Frequency: {series_data['series']['frequency']}")
print(f"Category: {series_data['series']['category']}")
​
Step 2: Get Today’s Events and Markets
Now that we have the series information, let’s get the markets for this series. We’ll use the Get Markets endpoint with the series ticker filter to find all active markets.

Python

JavaScript
# Get all markets for the KXHIGHNY series
markets_url = f"https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets?series_ticker=KXHIGHNY&status=open"
markets_response = requests.get(markets_url)
markets_data = markets_response.json()

print(f"\nActive markets in KXHIGHNY series:")
for market in markets_data['markets']:
    print(f"- {market['ticker']}: {market['title']}")
    print(f"  Event: {market['event_ticker']}")
    print(f"  Yes Price: {market['yes_price']}¢ | Volume: {market['volume']}")
    print()

# Get details for a specific event if you have its ticker
if markets_data['markets']:
    # Let's get details for the first market's event
    event_ticker = markets_data['markets'][0]['event_ticker']
    event_url = f"https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/events/{event_ticker}"
    event_response = requests.get(event_url)
    event_data = event_response.json()

    print(f"Event Details:")
    print(f"Title: {event_data['event']['title']}")
    print(f"Category: {event_data['event']['category']}")
You can view these markets in the Kalshi UI at: https://kalshi.com/markets/kxhighny
​
Step 3: Get Orderbook Data
Now let’s fetch the orderbook for a specific market to see the current bids and asks using the Get Market Orderbook endpoint.

Python

JavaScript
# Get orderbook for a specific market
# Replace with an actual market ticker from the markets list
market_ticker = markets_data['markets'][0]['ticker']
orderbook_url = f"https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets/{market_ticker}/orderbook"

orderbook_response = requests.get(orderbook_url)
orderbook_data = orderbook_response.json()

print(f"\nOrderbook for {market_ticker}:")
print("YES BIDS:")
for bid in orderbook_data['orderbook']['yes'][:5]:  # Show top 5
    print(f"  Price: {bid[0]}¢, Quantity: {bid[1]}")

print("\nNO BIDS:")
for bid in orderbook_data['orderbook']['no'][:5]:  # Show top 5
    print(f"  Price: {bid[0]}¢, Quantity: {bid[1]}")
​
Working with Large Datasets
The Kalshi API uses cursor-based pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. To learn more about navigating through paginated responses, see our Understanding Pagination guide.
​
Understanding Orderbook Responses
Kalshi’s orderbook structure is unique due to the nature of binary prediction markets. The API only returns bids (not asks) because of the reciprocal relationship between YES and NO positions. To learn more about orderbook responses and why they work this way, see our Orderbook Responses guide.
​
Next Steps
Now that you understand how to access market data without authentication, you can:
Explore other public series and events
Build real-time market monitoring tools
Create market analysis dashboards
Set up a WebSocket connection for live updates (requires authentication)
For authenticated endpoints that allow trading and portfolio management, check out our API Keys guide.

Quick Start: WebSockets
Learn how to establish and maintain a WebSocket connection to stream real-time market data

​
Overview
Kalshi’s WebSocket API provides real-time updates for:
Order book changes
Trade executions
Market status updates
Fill notifications (authenticated connections only)
​
Connection URL
Connect to the WebSocket endpoint at:
wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2
For the demo environment, use:
wss://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2
​
Authentication
WebSocket connections require authentication using the same API key signing mechanism as REST endpoints.
For detailed information about API key generation and request signing, see our API Keys documentation.
​
Required Headers
When establishing the WebSocket connection, include these headers:
KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY: your_api_key_id
KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE: request_signature
KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP: unix_timestamp_in_milliseconds
​
Signing the WebSocket Request
The signature for WebSocket connections follows the same pattern as REST API requests:
Create the message to sign:
timestamp + "GET" + "/trade-api/ws/v2"
Generate the signature using your private key (see API Keys documentation)
Include the headers when opening the WebSocket connection
​
Establishing a Connection
To connect to the WebSocket API, you need to:
Generate authentication headers (same as REST API)
Create a WebSocket connection with those headers
Handle the connection lifecycle
Here’s how to establish an authenticated connection:
import websockets
import asyncio

# WebSocket URL
ws_url = "wss://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2"  # Demo environment

# Generate authentication headers (see API Keys documentation)
auth_headers = {
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY": "your_api_key_id",
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE": "generated_signature",
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP": "timestamp_in_milliseconds"
}

# Connect with authentication
async def connect():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url, additional_headers=auth_headers) as websocket:
        print("Connected to Kalshi WebSocket")

        # Connection is now established
        # You can start sending and receiving messages

        # Listen for messages
        async for message in websocket:
            print(f"Received: {message}")

# Run the connection
asyncio.run(connect())
​
Subscribing to Data
Once connected, subscribe to channels by sending a subscription command:
import json

async def subscribe_to_ticker(websocket):
    """Subscribe to ticker updates"""
    subscription = {
        "id": 1,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker"]
        }
    }
    await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription))

async def subscribe_to_orderbook(websocket, market_tickers):
    """Subscribe to orderbook updates for specific markets"""
    subscription = {
        "id": 2,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["orderbook_delta"],
            "market_tickers": market_tickers
        }
    }
    await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription))
​
Processing Messages
Handle incoming messages based on their type:
async def process_message(message):
    """Process incoming WebSocket messages"""
    data = json.loads(message)
    msg_type = data.get("type")

    if msg_type == "ticker":
        # Handle ticker update
        market = data["data"]["market_ticker"]
        bid = data["data"]["bid"]
        ask = data["data"]["ask"]
        print(f"{market}: Bid ${bid}, Ask ${ask}")

    elif msg_type == "orderbook_snapshot":
        # Handle full orderbook state
        print(f"Orderbook snapshot for {data['data']['market_ticker']}")

    elif msg_type == "orderbook_update":
        # Handle orderbook changes
        print(f"Orderbook update for {data['data']['market_ticker']}")
        # Note: client_order_id field is optional - present only when you caused this change
        if 'client_order_id' in data['data']:
            print(f"  Your order {data['data']['client_order_id']} caused this change")

    elif msg_type == "error":
        error_code = data.get("msg", {}).get("code")
        error_msg = data.get("msg", {}).get("msg")
        print(f"Error {error_code}: {error_msg}")
​
Connection Keep-Alive
The Python websockets library automatically handles WebSocket ping/pong frames to keep connections alive. No manual heartbeat handling is required. Learn more about automatic keepalive in the websockets documentation.
Other WebSocket libraries may require manual ping/pong implementation.
​
Subscribing to Channels
Once connected, subscribe to specific data channels:
​
Subscribe to Ticker Updates
To receive real-time ticker updates for all markets:
async def subscribe_to_tickers(self):
    """Subscribe to ticker updates for all markets"""
    subscription_message = {
        "id": self.message_id,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker"]
        }
    }
    await self.ws.send(json.dumps(subscription_message))
    self.message_id += 1
​
Subscribe to Specific Markets
To subscribe to orderbook or trade updates for specific markets:
async def subscribe_to_markets(self, channels, market_tickers):
    """Subscribe to specific channels and markets"""
    subscription_message = {
        "id": self.message_id,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": channels,
            "market_tickers": market_tickers
        }
    }
    await self.ws.send(json.dumps(subscription_message))
    self.message_id += 1

# Example usage:
# Subscribe to orderbook updates
await subscribe_to_markets(["orderbook"], ["KXFUT24-LSV", "KXHARRIS24-LSV"])

# Subscribe to trade feed
await subscribe_to_markets(["trades"], ["KXFUT24-LSV"])
​
Connection Lifecycle
Initial Connection: Establish WebSocket with authentication headers
Subscribe: Send subscription commands for desired channels
Receive Updates: Process incoming messages based on their type
Handle Disconnects: Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
​
Error Handling
The server sends error messages in this format:
{
  "id": 123,
  "type": "error",
  "msg": {
    "code": 6,
    "msg": "Params required"
  }
}
​
WebSocket Error Codes
Code	Error	Description
1	Unable to process message	General processing error
2	Params required	Missing params object in command
3	Channels required	Missing channels array in subscribe
4	Subscription IDs required	Missing sids in unsubscribe
5	Unknown command	Invalid command name
7	Unknown subscription ID	Subscription ID not found
8	Unknown channel name	Invalid channel in subscribe
9	Authentication required	Private channel without auth
10	Channel error	Channel-specific error
11	Invalid parameter	Malformed parameter value
12	Exactly one subscription ID required	For update_subscription
13	Unsupported action	Invalid action for update_subscription
14	Market ticker required	Missing market specification
15	Action required	Missing action in update_subscription
16	Market not found	Invalid market ticker
17	Internal error	Server-side processing error
​
Best Practices
Connection Management
Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
Handle network interruptions gracefully
Use the websockets library’s built-in keepalive
Data Handling
Process messages asynchronously to avoid blocking
Implement proper error handling for malformed messages
Cache initial orderbook state before applying updates
Security
Never expose your private key in client-side code
Rotate API keys regularly
Use secure key storage practices
Performance
Subscribe only to markets you need
Implement message buffering for high-frequency updates
Consider using connection pooling for multiple subscriptions

Kalshi Glossary
Core terminology used in the Kalshi exchange

Here are some core terminologies used in Kalshi exchange:
Market: A single binary market. This is a low level object which rarely will need to be exposed on its own to members. The usage of the term “market” here is consistent with how it’s used in the backend and API.
Event: An event is a collection of markets and the basic unit that members should interact with on Kalshi.
Series: A series is a collection of related events. The following should hold true for events that make up a series:
Each event should look at similar data for determination, but translated over another, disjoint time period.
Series should never have a logical outcome dependency between events.
Events in a series should have the same ticker prefix.
Please see the “Timeline and Payout” dropdown on a market’s page to find the Market, Event, and Series tickers. Note that the market ticker will depend on which market you are looking at on that page. For example, Trump and Harris are each their own market.

Breaking Change
Upcoming
Breaking changes to order expiration and immediate-or-cancel (IoC) handling:
Past expiration timestamps now rejected: Orders with expiration_ts in the past will be rejected with error “Expiration timestamp must be in the future” instead of being automatically converted to IoC orders.
IoC + expiration_ts combination rejected: Orders cannot specify both time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel" and expiration_ts. This will be rejected at the API level with error “Cannot specify both immediate_or_cancel and expiration_ts”.
IoC orders no longer support expiration: The IoC order type is now independent and does not accept an expiration timestamp.
Migration guide: If you were previously using past expiration_ts values to indicate IoC behavior, you must now explicitly set time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel" instead.
Expected release: TBD

Nov 6, 2025
Bug Fix
Upcoming
Fixed two issues with the GET /events endpoint’s limit parameter:

Parameter: Requests with with_nested_markets=true now properly respect limit=200 instead of being capped at 100
​
Nov 6, 2025

"exclude" - Excludes multivariate events
No parameter - Returns all events (default behavior)
Expected release: November 6th, 2025
​
Oct 24, 2025
Bug Fix
Upcoming
Fixed batch order creation to return proper error details when post-only orders cross the market. The response now includes:
Error code: "invalid order"
Error details: "post only cross"
This makes the batch endpoint consistent with single order creation and provides clear feedback on why post-only orders were rejected.
​
Oct 20, 2025
Released
The GET /portfolio/orders endpoint’s event_ticker parameter now supports filtering by multiple events using comma-separated values.
Example usage:
GET /portfolio/orders?event_ticker=EVENT1,EVENT2,EVENT3

The price_level_structure field has been moved from the event level to the market level. Each market now has its own price_level_structure field.
Affected endpoints:
GET /trade-api/v2/events
GET /trade-api/v2/events/:event_ticker
GET /trade-api/v2/markets
GET /trade-api/v2/markets/:ticker
Note: The price_level_structure field on event objects is now deprecated and will be removed. Please use the field on individual market objects instead.
Expected release date: Oct 15th, 2025
​
Oct 13, 2025
Bug Fix
Breaking Change
Released
Fixed the GET /series endpoint’s tags parameter to properly support tags containing spaces. Previously, the parameter would split on both commas AND spaces, breaking searches for tags like “Rotten Tomatoes”.
Breaking Change:
The tags query parameter now only splits on commas (,), not spaces
Tags with spaces (e.g., “Rotten Tomatoes”) now work correctly
Multiple tags must be comma-separated: ?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television
Before (broken):
GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
// Was incorrectly parsed as: ["Rotten", "Tomatoes"]
// Result: No matches found
After (fixed):
GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
// Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes"]
// Result: Returns series with the "Rotten Tomatoes" tag

GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television
// Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes", "Television"]
// Result: Returns series with either tag
This change may affect integrations that relied on space-separated tags. Please update to use comma-separated tags only.
​
Oct 8, 2025
Bug Fix
Released
Fixed routing inconsistency where certain collection endpoints required trailing slashes, causing unnecessary 301 redirects for requests without them.
Endpoints now returning 200 for requests without trailing slash (previously returned 301):
GET /milestones
GET /structured_targets
GET /multivariate_event_collections
GET /series
GET /api_keys
POST /api_keys
Note: Requests with trailing slashes (e.g., /milestones/) will now receive a 301 redirect to the version without the trailing slash, which is the opposite of the previous behavior.
​
Oct 9, 2025
Released
Subpenny fields have been added to orders (taker_fees_dollars, maker_fees_dollars), as well as to public trades (yes_price_dollars, no_price_dollars).
Endpoints affected:

​
Oct 1, 2025
Released
The GET /series/fee_changes endpoint now returns user-facing fee type names (quadratic, quadratic_with_maker_fees, flat) instead of internal fee structure names. This change also applies to CustomerIO notifications for scheduled series fee updates.
Expected release: October 1, 2025
​
Sep 25, 2025
Released
Repeated subscriptions on the same websocket call will no longer error. If passing the same market tickers as before, no action will be taken. If passing new market tickers, they will be added to your existing subscription.
Additionally, the user may supply WS Command list_subscriptions to view their existing subscriptions.
Expected release: October 1, 2025
​
Sep 25, 2025
Released
For optimization purposes, partial fills generated by self-crossing FoK orders are not rolled back. If a FoK order self-crosses, order execution proceeds based on self_trade_prevention_type:
taker_at_cross: the taker is canceled, execution stops. Any partial fills are executed.
maker: the maker is canceled, execution continues. After execution, remaining taker quantity is canceled. Any fills are executed.
This fixes a bug where partially filled FoK orders with Maker STP entered into the book after self-crossing. Expected enforced date: Oct 1, 2025.
​
Sep 22, 2025
Released
User seeking a simple way to determine the direction of their fill should reference purchased_side. Both BUY YES or SELL NO result in purchased_side = YES. The addition of this field is the first step in standardizing the fills websocket and REST endpoints, which have different conventions for the interpretation ‘side’ and ‘user_action’.
Expected Enforce Date: deprecation date for existing fields not yet scheduled.
​
Sep 21, 2025
Released
Added new public API endpoint for getting all of a series’ scheduled fees:
GET /series/fee_changes - Get a series’ fee changes. If query string parameter show_historical is set to true, ALL fee changes previous and upcoming will be shown. If set to false, only upcoming fee changes will be shown
​
Sep 25, 2025
Breaking Change
Released
Specifying order_type is no longer required and only limit type orders will be supported. Price must be supplied based on the underlying market structure. Example usage:
{"yes_price": 99, "side: "yes"} // buy yes or sell no at market price
{"no_price": 99, "side: "no"} // buy no or sell yes at market price
Expected enforce date: Sep 25, 2025

Aug 31, 2025
Breaking Change
Released
Subpenny pricing fields have been added to APIs involving price, fees, and money in general. E.g. next to a field called "price": 12 (representing 12 cents), you will also see "price_dollars": "0.1200", which is a string bearing a fixed-point representation of money accuate to at 4 decimal points.
For now, this change is read-only, meaning that the minimum allowable tick size for orders is still 1c. Eventually, we will introduce sub-penny pricing on orders. For now, please prepare for an eventual migration to the higher granularity price representation.

Rate Limits and Tiers
Understanding API rate limits and access tiers

​
Access tiers
Tier	Read	Write
Basic	20 per second	10 per second
Advanced	30 per second	30 per second
Premier	100 per second	100 per second
Prime	400 per second	400 per second
Qualification for tiers:
Basic: Completing signup
Advanced: Completing https://kalshi.typeform.com/advanced-api
Premier: 3.75% of exchange traded volume in a given month
Prime: 7.5% of exchange traded volume in a given month
In addition to the volume targets, technical competency is a requirement for Premier/Prime access. Before providing access to the Premier/Prime tiers, the Exchange will establish that the trader/trading entity has the following requirements met:
Knowledge of common security practices for API usage
Proficiency in setting up monitoring for API usage, and ability to monitor API usage in near real-time
Understanding and implementation of rate limiting and throttling mechanisms imposed by the API, and the ability to self-limit load
Awareness of legal and compliance aspects related to API usage
Only the following APIs fall under the write limit, for the batch APIs, each item in the batch is considered 1 transaction with the sole exception of BatchCancelOrders, where each cancel counts as 0.2 transactions:
BatchCreateOrders
BatchCancelOrders
CreateOrder
CancelOrder
AmendOrder
DecreaseOrder
We reserve the right to downgrade your API rate limit tier from Prime and Premier when you have shown lack of activity in the previous period.
At any time, any Member that uses FIX or is at the highest possible API tier is eligible for an upgrade to its rate limit upon demonstration that such a tier is necessary for its bona fide market activity.

API Keys
API Key usage

This process is the same for the demo or production environment.
​
Generating an API Key
​
Access the Account Settings Page:
Log in to your account and navigate to the “Account Settings” page. You can typically find this option by clicking on your profile picture or account icon in the top-right corner of the application.
​
Generate a New API Key
In the “Profile Settings” page https://kalshi.com/account/profile, locate the “API Keys” section. Click on the “Create New API Key” button. This action will generate a new API key in the RSA_PRIVATE_KEY format.
​
Store Your API Key and Key ID:
After generating the key, you will be presented with: • Private Key: This is your secret key in RSA_PRIVATE_KEY format. • Key ID: This is a unique identifier associated with your private key.
Important: For security reasons, the private key will not be stored by our service, and you will not be able to retrieve it again once this page is closed. Please make sure to securely copy and save the private key immediately. The key will also be downloaded as txt file with the name provided.
​
Using a API Key
Each request to Kalshi trading api will need to be signed with the private key generated above.
The following header values will need to be provided with each request:
KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY- the Key ID
KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP - the request timestamp in ms
KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE- request hash signed with private key
The above signature is generated by signing a concatenation of the timestamp, the HTTP method and the path.
Important: When signing requests, use the path without query parameters. For example, if your request is to /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders?limit=5, sign only /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders (strip the ? and everything after it).
Sample code for generating the required headers is below (alternatively use our example code here):
​
Python
Load the private key stored in a file
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def load_private_key_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "rb") as key_file:
        private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
            key_file.read(),
            password=None,  # or provide a password if your key is encrypted
            backend=default_backend()
        )
    return private_key
Sign text with private key

            hashes.SHA256()
        )
